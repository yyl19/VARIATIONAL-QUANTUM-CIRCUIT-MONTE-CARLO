This repository contains the source code, written in Julia, for the article "[Maximising Quantum-Computing Expressive Power through Randomised Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01947)". 

The package used to construct the quantum circuit available at "[https://github.com/guochu/VQC.jl]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01947](https://github.com/guochu/VQC.jl))" can be implemented with any existing open source quantum package
